**Data:** [v1 (tar.gz)](factuality_eng_udewt_v1.tar.gz), [v2 (tar.gz)](factuality_eng_udewt_v2.tar.gz)

A central function of natural language is to convey information about the properties of events. Perhaps the most fundamental of these properties is factuality: whether an event happened or not.

In this line of work, we develop a factuality annotation that incorporates a notion of confidence. This allows us to handle a wide variety of cases where the factuality of an event is unclear.
