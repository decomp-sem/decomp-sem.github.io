## PredPatt

[Github](https://github.com/hltcoe/PredPatt)

PredPatt is a framework for extracting extensible, interpretable, language-neutral predicate-argument patterns. PredPatt bridges the deep syntax of the Universal Dependency project to an initial shallow semantic layer: this can form the basis for future layering of semantic annotations atop Universal Dependency treebanks, and separately can be considered a linguistically well-founded component of a "Universal IE" mechanism.
